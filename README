  SKKYE is a social media network that matches people with friends based on personal interests and personality types.

  The first step to setting up a SKKYE account is to enter your personal information. From there, you will take a personality quiz
that matches you with one of five personality types (chill, charming, imaginitive, adventurous, or outgoing).

  After SKKYE determines your personality type it will match you with one of our profiles in the system and from there you can add and chat with new friends.<3
